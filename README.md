# Jake Oliger's Portfolio Website... Reactified.

I've turned [my portfolio website](https://jakeoliger.com/) (see [GitHub repository](https://github.com/JakeOliger/Portfolio/)) into a single page React app, still using Laravel as a basic backend, but I'm really using very few Laravel features currently on this website.

The website is hosted at [react.jakeoliger.com](https://react.jakeoliger.com/).

The purpose of this project is to re-familiarize myself with ReactJS and practice building components and structuring a program with composition.
